# <Weather Dashboard>

## Description

This project was made with the intention of learning more about calling API's and dynamically populating sections of a website with the retrieved data. This dashboard allows you to search for a city and you are given weather data about that city in the present, and also for the next five days. This problem let me learn a lot about how to call API's with the fetch command and then how to look through the data and figure out what data is needed. I also learned how to change elements of the API link so that I could get better data back. For example, the temperature was originally in Kelvin so I had to change the link to make the data display in farenheit. I also learned a lot about debugging because getting this working was a process.

## Credits

This would not have been possible without the guidance of my dad. We also asked chatgpt some questions regarding how to average the temperatures. Thanks to both of them.
